## About me
I am a hard-working Software Engineer dedicated to my work and always ready to learn and improve myself. I focus on developing distributed services that are performant, efficient, resilient, and maintainable. These services need to handle data at a very large scale; therefore, I pay big attention to designing solutions that can process, store, and query data efficiently.
I believe in agile cross-functional teams that can work together throughout the delivery pipeline and constantly push out value to the customer while maintaining a high level of quality.

Graduated from Notre Dame University, Lebanon.

## Experience

### Relay42 / Amsterdam, the Netherlands
*October 2018 - Present*
-	Developed a Java based service that processes huge volumes of data from AWS Kinesis and routes them to external data partners through their public APIs. The service must be efficient and scalable to easily absorb spikes in traffic, while being resilient to external errors and gracefully resume normal operation.
-	Augmented an existing Java based service to store statistics in AWS RDS and added the needed endpoints to query the data for charts and reports.
-	Infrastructure-as-Code to automate environment provisioning and configuration using Terraform and Ansible.
-	Worked in a multi-culture organization and collaborate across teams.
-	Worked in cross-functional teams.
-	Manage and monitor work using JIRA.

### Smarty Systems / Zalka, Lebanon
*February 2017 – August 2018*
-	Designed a service that ingests an online stream of news document and store them in Elastic Search. APIs where exposed to search for documents. I was heavily engaged in search optimization to find similar news articles relevant to user queries.
-	Designed a service that ingests social media statistics and store them in a data warehouse. The stack was based on CDH hence we used Apache Kudu as our data store. Other solutions were tested such as Apache Druid and Vertica. APIs where exposed to query and aggregate statistics for charts and reports.
-	Designed a service for streaming live news to the user based on custom filters.
-	Designed a service for ingesting social profiles and interests and creating an actor graph using Neo4j. APIs where exposed to discover patterns and relationships from the graph.
-	Maintain these set of microservices based on Spring Boot and the Spring Cloud stack. Embracing techniques such as service discovery using Hashicorp Consul.
-	Work in cross-functional teams. The feature would span backend (data storage and query API) and front end (integration with API). Therefore, API contracts had to be established before-hand and well documented.
-	Realtime online processing of statistics data to calculate metrics such as trend and feed it to a backend machine learning API for online prediction. The real time processing was done using VoltDB, a fast in-memory RDBMS.

### Space Builders / Beirut, Lebanon
*May 2015 – May 2016*
-	Windows Server Essentials setup for collaboration across the office.
-	Network set up for remote access
-	Created advanced Excel sheets and Access databases for generating reports
